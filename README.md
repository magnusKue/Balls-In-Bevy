first bevy game following a tutorial by Jacques (YT)

Simple 2d topdown game which has the player avoid enemies and collect stars to maximise their score.

## How to play:

The game is auto paused on launch so you'll need to press "space" to resume.
To switch between the game and the main menu you can use "g" and "m".
Score is only printed to the console, there is no HUD.
